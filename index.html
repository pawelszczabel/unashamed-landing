  <!-- SECTION 1: I KNOW YOU -->
  <section class="know-you" id="i-know-you">
    <div class="container">
      <div class="section-divider"></div>
      <p class="lead reveal">Your daily life is a performance that never ends. Let me describe it — and you tell me if
        I'm wrong.</p>

      <div class="know-you-grid">
        <div class="know-card reveal reveal-delay-1">
          <h3>At work: the perfect machine</h3>
          <p>You show up sharp. Suit on, plan ready, emotions off. You're rational, composed, effective — because you
            have to be. Every day is full mobilization. Not because the job demands it, but because you're terrified
            that if you slip for one second, someone will see through the mask.</p>
          <p>You've been promoted. You've delivered. And yet you feel like a fraud. You won't change jobs — not because
            you love this one, but because you're convinced that in a new place, they'll finally figure out you're not
            that good.</p>
          <p>Sunday evenings are the worst. The dread of Monday. The tightness in your chest. The mask goes back on in a
            few hours, and you can already feel it pressing against your face.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="know-card reveal reveal-delay-2">
          <h3>At home: the escape</h3>
          <p>You walk through the door and the armor stays on. Your partner asks how your day was. "Fine." That's all
            she gets.</p>
          <p>Instead of talking, you sit in front of a screen until 2 AM. Not because you have work to do — because you
            can't face what you'd feel if you stopped. You can't tell her you're exhausted. You can't tell her you're
            drowning. Because real men don't complain.</p>
          <p>When your kid falls asleep on your shoulder and tears start pressing against your eyes, you swallow them.
            You don't give yourself permission to be moved. Not here. Not now. Not ever.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="know-card reveal reveal-delay-3">
          <h3>In relationships: the poker face</h3>
          <p>In bed, you play the tough guy — because you never learned the language of tenderness. You're ashamed of
            your body. The scars. The belly. You won't make love with the lights on.</p>
          <p>You can't say "I miss you." You can't say "I need to be held." So you wait for her to guess. And when she
            doesn't, you punish her with silence. With coldness. With distance.</p>
          <p>When stress hits, instead of saying "I'm scared" or "I don't know," you go blank. Poker face. You shut down
            or you attack — anything to divert attention from the fact that you're helpless.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="know-card reveal reveal-delay-4">
          <h3>In your body: the alarm that never stops</h3>
          <p>Your body lives in permanent fight-or-flight. Tension in your shoulders. Eyes that avoid contact. A voice
            that gets stuck in your throat. Face flushing at the worst possible moments.</p>
          <p>You have the iPhone. The gym membership. The diploma on the wall. And inside, you feel utterly alone.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="know-you-closing reveal">
        <p><strong>This isn't weakness. This isn't laziness. This isn't ego.</strong></p>
        <p><strong>This is what happens when shame runs your life — and you don't even know it has a name.</strong></p>
      </div>

  <!-- SECTION 2: SHAME IS THE ENEMY -->
  <section class="shame-section" id="shame">
    <div class="container shame-enemy">
      <div class="section-divider"></div>
      <h2 class="reveal">Here's what nobody told&nbsp;you</h2>
      <p class="reveal">The thing that keeps you locked inside that armor isn't discipline. It isn't ambition. It isn't
        "being a man."</p>
      <p class="reveal"><strong class="text-accent" style="font-size: 1.3em;">It's shame.</strong></p>

      <ul class="shame-lines reveal">
        <li>Shame is the voice that says: <em>"If they really knew you, they'd leave."</em></li>
        <li>Shame is why you can't be vulnerable with your partner.</li>
        <li>Shame is why you work yourself to the bone instead of asking for help.</li>
        <li>Shame is why you feel like a fraud even when you succeed.</li>
      </ul>

      <blockquote class="reveal">
        "What is the seal of attained liberty? — To be no longer ashamed of oneself."
        <cite>Friedrich Nietzsche, <em>The Gay Science</em>, 1882</cite>
      </blockquote>

      <p class="reveal">He understood that shame is the deepest prison — because you carry the walls with you everywhere
        you go. No one needs to lock the door. You do it yourself.</p>

  <!-- SECTION 3: WAY OUT -->
  <section class="way-out" id="way-out">
    <div class="container">
      <div class="section-divider"></div>
      <h2 class="reveal">There's a name for it. And a&nbsp;way&nbsp;out.</h2>
      <p class="reveal">What you're living through isn't a personality flaw. It's not "just how men are." It has a name,
        a mechanism, and — most importantly — an exit.</p>
      <p class="reveal"><strong>UNASHAMED</strong> is a 10-module audio course and PDF guide built for men who are done
        performing. Done hiding. Done dying in silence.</p>
      <p class="reveal">This isn't therapy-speak. This isn't "just journal about your feelings and everything will be
        okay." This is a direct, honest confrontation with the thing that's been running your life from the shadows.</p>

      <div class="way-out-pillars">
        <div class="pillar reveal reveal-delay-1">
          <h4>Philosophy that cuts through the noise</h4>
          <p>Nietzsche understood shame 140 years before Instagram made it an epidemic. His work on self-overcoming is
            the foundation — how to stop living by rules someone else wrote for you.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="pillar reveal reveal-delay-2">
          <h4>The science of why you feel like a fraud</h4>
          <p>Brené Brown spent 20 years researching shame. Her framework explains exactly why you can't say "I'm not
            okay" — and how to start.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="pillar reveal reveal-delay-3">
          <h4>The conditioning you never agreed to</h4>
          <p>Pavlov trained dogs to salivate at a bell. Someone trained you to feel shame at the sound of your own
            honesty. You can undo that training.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="pillar reveal reveal-delay-4">
          <h4>Your brain on perfectionism</h4>
          <p>Neuroscience shows perfectionists' brains treat mistakes like mortal danger — 60% higher activation in the
            fear center. That's why you freeze. And it can be rewired.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="pillar reveal reveal-delay-1">
          <h4>Your voice as a weapon</h4>
          <p>Voice therapy techniques that change how you feel from the inside out. Actual physical tools — breathing,
            resonance, projection — that rebuild the way you carry yourself.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="pillar reveal reveal-delay-2">
          <h4>Self-love that isn't bullshit</h4>
          <p>The difference between healthy self-regard and destructive narcissism. Why you need to start taking up
            space — without apology.</p>

        <p>I'm not a therapist. I'm not a guru. I'm not here to fix you because you're not broken — you're trapped.</p>
        <p>I'm one of you. A man who got sick of living in the prison of shame. Sick of being my own shadow. Sick of
          playing roles I never chose. Sick of wearing masks I never wanted.</p>
        <p>I built this course because I needed it first. And because I know there are thousands of men like me — men
          who look like they have it all together, but inside they're dying in silence.</p>
        <p>This is the course I wish someone had handed me years ago. Direct. Honest. No bullshit.</p>
        <p class="about-signature">My name is Tony Abel. I'm 37. I have two kids. I've had enough of living under the
          rule of shame — so I'm not staying quiet anymore.</p>
