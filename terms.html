        <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
        <p class="updated">Last updated: February 20, 2026</p>

        <p>These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your use of the website <a
                href="https://unashamed.app">unashamed.app</a> and the purchase of digital products offered by UNASHAMED
            ("we", "us", "our"). By using our website or purchasing our products, you agree to these Terms.</p>

        <h2>1. Seller Information</h2>
        <p><strong>Paweł Szczabel</strong><br>
            NIP: 9910361892<br>
            ul. Wygonowa 51/2A, 45-402 Opole, Poland<br>
            Email: <a href="mailto:tony.unashamed@gmail.com">tony.unashamed@gmail.com</a><br>
            Website: <a href="https://unashamed.app">https://unashamed.app</a></p>

        <h2>2. Product Description</h2>
        <p>UNASHAMED is a digital educational product consisting of:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>10 audio modules in MP3 format</li>
            <li>1 PDF companion guide</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The course is an <strong>educational product</strong>, not therapy, medical advice, or professional
            counseling. If you are experiencing a mental health crisis, please contact a qualified professional.</p>
        <p><strong>Price</strong>: €29 (EUR). Pricing includes all applicable taxes.</p>

        <h2>3. Purchase and Delivery</h2>
        <p>Upon successful payment through our payment processor (EasyCart), you will receive <strong>immediate
                access</strong> to download the digital files. Delivery is instant — no physical products are shipped.
        </p>

        <h2>4. Right of Withdrawal (14-Day Refund)</h2>
        <p>In accordance with <strong>EU Directive 2011/83/EU</strong> (Consumer Rights Directive) and <strong>Polish
                Consumer Rights Act (Ustawa o prawach konsumenta, Art. 27)</strong>, you have the right to withdraw from
            the purchase within <strong>14 calendar days</strong> without giving any reason.</p>
        <p>To exercise your right of withdrawal, send an email to <a
                href="mailto:tony.unashamed@gmail.com">tony.unashamed@gmail.com</a> stating your wish to withdraw. We
            will process your refund within <strong>14 days</strong> of receiving your withdrawal request, using the
            same payment method used for the original purchase.</p>
        <p><strong>Important</strong>: Under Art. 38(13) of the Polish Consumer Rights Act, the right of withdrawal may
            not apply to digital content that has been fully delivered if the consumer has given prior express consent
            to begin performance and acknowledged that the right of withdrawal will be lost. We do not invoke this
            exception — <strong>we honor the full 14-day refund period regardless of download status</strong>.</p>
