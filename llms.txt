## About

2. **The power of self-worship** — Why healthy narcissism is a weapon against shame, not a weakness.
3. **The trained dog in you** — How Pavlovian conditioning creates automatic shame responses and how to break them.
4. **The zoo of the defeated** — Archetypes of shame-driven behavior: The Victim, The Martyr, The Mouse, The Clown.
5. **The paralysis of the flawless** — Why perfectionism triggers amygdala activation 60% above normal and how to overcome it.
6. **The great reveal** — How to stop hiding what you're ashamed of and speak it out loud.
7. **The voice that sets you free** — Voice therapy techniques (breathing, resonance, projection) to rebuild self-image.
8. **Fall for yourself** — Building unconditional self-trust and self-love as a daily practice.
9. **Beautiful cruelty** — The art of confronting personal and interpersonal dishonesty with warmth and precision.
10. **The prayer of the unashamed** — A closing declaration of freedom from shame.
